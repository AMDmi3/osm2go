+ decrease way references in osm_node_chain_free
+ remove dirty flag in successful upload
+ create visual representation for node that get tags and remove
  it from nodes that have all tags removed
+ Tag database, e.g. from
  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Tagwatch/Descriptions/de
  (done using JOSMs presets.xml)
+ clean up mouse handling
+ cleaner selection handling with respect to invisible nodes
+ switch to goocanvas
+ use normal mercartor instead of utm
+ check bounds for placed/moved nodes
- scale (overlay?)
+ include ways, a node is part of, into relation check
o remove double first/last points from polygons (not worth the effort)
- avoid duplicate nodes in ways after node removal
+ prevent placing of things outside map
+ use first label in presets as dialog name
+ scale presets dialogs nicer
+ join nodes (blue touchnode)
- make projects without osm file editable but not openable
- colorize on-the-fly
+ fix hildon first-char-is-uppercase problem (e.g. in password dialog)
+ Use http://maemo.org/downloads/product/raw/OS2008/osm2go/?get_installfile
- Use JOSMs elemstyles.xml
- Handle relations
+ Use a real toolbar for the iconbar
+ keep wms layer after upload
- use systems proxy settings
+ scroll by cursor keys/dpad
+ "tag clash" resolve dialog used when joining nodes/ways
+ exclude ways with "new" nodes from upload. (e.g. upload failure)
- exclude nodes with existing ways from deletion (e.g. after way del failure)
+ retry on "internal server error" 500 
+ upload order: create/modify nodes, create/modify ways, del ways, del nodes
+ combine presets into existing tags
- use osm_is_creator_tag whereever possible
+ highlight duplicate tags in info dialog
+ flexible left column of info dialogs tag view
- useful key bindings in dialogs
+ update visual node representation when incl. one into a way
- move map edit functions into seperate file (e.g. map_edit.c)
+ update relations of ways or nodes which are deleted 
+ upload dirty relations
+ special handling of relations if ways are joined (join all shared relations)
+ share relations between split ways
+ store relation changes in diff
+ end ways by double click
+ automatically open the info dialog after new way and new node
+ basic map hard key bindings
+ prefer wms jpg over png over gif
+ download in osm menu
+ save zoom and scroll offset in project
+ store credentials globally in gconf instead of project file
- dismiss project dirty flag completely?
+ don't overwrite "last_tags" by ways tags when selecting subnode of a way
  (solved by completely seperating the handling of way and node tags)
+ "cancel" in info dialog
+ use "don't show this dialog again" dialogs for questions
+.prevent a "no" on delete dialog if "don't show again" is selected
+ cut way at node
- join ways at common node (do we really need this?)
+ extend ways
+ join new way with existing one if its last node is end node of the other way
+ show/change ways direction
+ option to show all nodes of a way (done via style)
+ don't move touchnode
+ gui to handle "role" in relation membership
- auto save (at least until the editor is stable)
+ use josms elemstyle
+ create a potlatch style elemstyle
+ style selection
+ generic file handling routines in misc.c
+ repaint map after style change
+ move all styles/colors from map.h to *.style
- permanent dialog disabling
+ partial map redraw (selected layers only)
- honour elemstyle min/max scale
+ use real pixmap width instead of hard coded value
- fix icon scaling issue
+ make ui work without project loaded
- progress indicators
- determine nice default scroll position for new projects
+ redo file structure before svn import
- unify download management, cope with none/invalid osm file present
- fix inconsistant RGB/RGBA usage
